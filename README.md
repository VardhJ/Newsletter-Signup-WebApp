# Newsletter-Signup-WebApp
I have made a Newsletter signup Web Application with MailChimp API to make a mailing(subscriber) list.

I have used the concepts of HTML to make the signup, success(if subscribed) and failure(if could not subscribe) pages.
I have used CSS to style the above pages.
I have used Javascript and node.js to handle the GET and POST requests that a user makes to submit the form and retrieve the data that I have asked for.
I have also used the mailchimp API to make a mailing list.
